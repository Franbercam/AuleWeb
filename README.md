# AuleWeb
The AuleWeb site represents a simplified version of the classroom management system of our University (https://aule.linfcop.univaq.it).

## Características

We want to inform our users and collaborators that, despite the fact that our project is mainly developed in English, we have used the Spanish language in certain aspects such as the name of the functions, the database and other related elements. This is because Spanish is our native language and we have found comfort and fluency in reasoning and deducing in this language during development.

However, we want to emphasize that our project is aimed at a global audience and we have ensured that the frontend and user interface are completely in English. This includes all the labels, messages, documentation and visual elements present in the application.

Our primary goal is to ensure a seamless and accessible experience for all of our users, regardless of their native language. Therefore, we have made significant efforts to provide an English interface that makes the project easy to understand and use.

We appreciate the understanding and support of our global community as we continually work to improve and adapt our project to the needs of all users.

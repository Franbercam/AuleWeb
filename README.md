# AuleWeb
The AuleWeb site represents a simplified version of the classroom management system of our University (https://aule.linfcop.univaq.it).

## Characteristics
We want to inform our users and collaborators that, despite the fact that our project is mainly developed in English, we have used the Spanish language in certain aspects such as the name of the functions, the database and other related elements. This is because Spanish is our native language and we have found comfort and fluency in reasoning and deducing in this language during development.

However, we want to emphasize that our project is aimed at a global audience and we have ensured that the frontend and user interface are completely in English. This includes all the labels, messages, documentation and visual elements present in the application.

Our primary goal is to ensure a seamless and accessible experience for all of our users, regardless of their native language. Therefore, we have made significant efforts to provide an English interface that makes the project easy to understand and use.

We appreciate the understanding and support of our global community as we continually work to improve and adapt our project to the needs of all users.


## Instalation requirements
Read documentation inside docs folder.

## Use guide
We are excited to introduce you to our web application project, which leverages a database to provide powerful functionality. As we cannot guarantee the presence of preloaded content or the successful creation of the database upon project deployment, we have included an SQL file and CSV data files within the project. These resources need to be executed by you to ensure the efficient usage of our web application.

To simplify the process for you, we have incorporated functions within our SQLConstructor.java file (inside SQL Package) that automate the database initialization steps. These functions will assist you in setting up the necessary base data for the application to function optimally.

Here is a step-by-step guide to help you initialize the database:

    Locate the SQLConstructor.java file within our project.

    Open the SQLConstructor.java file using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

    Within the SQLConstructor.java file, you will find functions specifically designed to facilitate the initialization of the database and its associated data.

    Prior to executing the SQLConstructor.java file, ensure that you have an appropriate database management system (DBMS) installed and running (executing database.sql, inside docs folder).

    Once the initialization process is complete, the database will be properly set up, and you can enjoy the full functionality of our web application.
